h1. FMQ

h2. &#x2192; 'Free Message Queue'

h2. What

The project implements a queue system with a server and some client apis.

The server is a mongrel web server that holds REST-named queues. 
You can GET, POST, DELETE, HEAD queue messages using the normal HTTP requests. 
The system itself uses a configuration file (YAML) to setup queues at startup or even at runtime. 
The queue implementations can be changed using an easy plugin system right from your project directory. 

For an simple administration and try out of the system, FMQ has an integrated ajax based web interface.

The client apis are implemented using the HTTP protocol, so that you can use even curl to receive messages. 
Ruby is implemented right now, other languages will follow.

The queue itself is an URL like http://localhost:5884/myQueueName/ or http://localhost:5884/myApplication/myQueueName/.
If you do a GET request to this url with a web browser you will receive one message from the queue.

h2. Features

* FIFO message store
* easy setup and maintenance of system
* using http for communication
* changeable queue implementation
* ruby client lib
* simple ajax admin interface
* **queues to** return same file every time (debugging)
* **queues to** forward messages to several queues
* **queues to** store data in a FIFO in memory (for high performance)

h2. Installing

<pre syntax="ruby">sudo gem install fmq</pre>

h2. First steps

After installing the gem you can start by creating a project:

<pre>fmq create my_project_name</pre>

next step is to change to the folder and start the FMQ server:
<pre>cd my_project_name
fmq</pre>

The server will start and host a admin interface on "http://localhost:5884/admin/index":http://localhost:5884/admin/index.

Have a look at "rDoc":http://fmq.rubyforge.org/rdoc/classes/FreeMessageQueue/ClientQueue.html to see how to use the client api.

h2. Git, patches, forks and all that stuff

If you want to clone the git repositiory use the command below. Patches, forks and feature requests are welcome, please send them to
<em>fmq-3z (at) gmx.net</em>.

<pre>git clone git://github.com/threez/fmq.git</pre>

h3. Build and test instructions

<pre>cd fmq
rake test
rake install_gem</pre>

h2. Loadtest

<p>To check the performance we have done a load test. 
The system under test was a 2 GB dual-core intel 1.8 Ghz with 100 Mbit/s LAN and Ruby 1.8.6.
In the test we simulate 20 applications (with 20 threads).
Each of this applications did 2 POSTs and 1 GET request for 30min. The POST requests where about 1KB.</p>
<p>This are the results (from 2008-06-10; MongrelHandler):</p>
